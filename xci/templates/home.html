<p>Welcome to the ADL Competency App! To get started, please login, or if you're new, sign up. Once you click the 'Get Started' button, the app will take you to the All Competencies page that lists all of the competency frameworks that have been added to the system. If there aren't any listed, there are three links above you can click to add those competencies to the system. Once you add the ones you want, they will appear below and you can click them to add them to YOUR competency list. Once they have been added to your list, click 'My Competencies' to begin the activites associated with each competency. When viewing the competency, you have the chance to change the LRS endpoint above it. Click each competency link listed to complete the necessary activity to achieve the competency. If you're looking at the Tetris competency, you'll be able to view the badges you have earned while playing by clicking the 'My Badges' button, or you can view all possible badges to attain by clicking the 'All Badges' button. NOTE: On each competency page you'll have the option to change the LRS endpoint. All that does is show you what competencies you have met at that particular endpoint for that particular subject. Everytime you leave the page it will get set back to the default endpoint.</p>
